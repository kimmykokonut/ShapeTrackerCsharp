# Shape Tracker
_a console application that user can enter lengths for triangle or rectangle sides and get the triangle's type or the rectangle's area.  an instance list of triangles is created and can be seen by user and cleared by user_

### Skills
* TDD with MSTest
* RGR testing workflow
* C#

#### Todo
* app is unfinished. it needs to offer the user the option to view the list of created rectangles, to delete the list and clean up the branching.
* would like the code more modular, the rectangle UI feels repetitive to the triangle UI in Program.cs

### Setup Instructions

2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "ShapeTracker".
3. In the command line, run the command "dotnet run" to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.
